		            <p>With the recent success adaptation of Big Hero 6 as well as being fans of Pixar and Hayao Miyazaki’s work, my friends and I believed that a good story was enough to help create a something great. We began with an idea of making a simple website with our comics, but as we brainstormed, we couldn’t help but to ask ourselves, “what if there’s more to it? What if we can inspire and help other artist and writers out to inspire the rest of the world?” We want to help the generations to come see the world from our eyes, experience the wonders that guided us through our childhood, and ultimately carry on the legacy of the great story tellers that came before us.<br><br>As a team we are currently working hard to produce contents and update as frequently as possible. The first iteration of the project didn't turn out as well as we hoped. Initially, the overall structure of the web site were great during our planning phase, however the final iteration of the web site, it  didn’t have the authenticity that we originally intended to have. The main issue arises from the fact that we were limited in our ability to code and overall knowledge of general web layout. All in all we did achieve what we originally set out to do, which was having a site to display our original content in a simple and straight forward manner.</p>

                    <p>Through SWOT analysis, we found that targeted age group should range from 10-22. We had a general consensuses that we want the website to be simple and kid friendly. As we divided the work load, my specific task was to design the website layout with another member as well as create the name and logo for the site.</p>

                      <p>Given another chance on this particular project, I would definitely spend more time on the idealization and creative process phase before settling down on the final layout of the website as the current layout still needs great amount of work. My original approach was to sketch only about 10 wire-frames for the layout and worked around those. However, I have come to realized that the creative process should be of lateral thinking and we shouldn’t be afraid to step back and redo the previous steps again in order to have a chance of creating something extraordinary.</p>

                      <p>As my skills continues to further developed, my friends and I decided that we should implement a new look to the site, something that's more clean and simple for the users. The goal was to remove unnecessary elements while implementing new elements that would help the user better navigate through the site. What started as some simple changes end up being a big overhaul of the entire website.</p>
