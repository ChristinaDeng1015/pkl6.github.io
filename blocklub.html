		            <p>With the recent successful adaptation of Big Hero 6 and as we are both fans of Pixar and Hayao Miyazaki’s work, we believe that anything with a good story that’s capable of driving the gears forward would help create a something great. We began with the idea of making just a website with our comics, but what if there’s more to it? What if we can inspire and help other artist and writers out to inspire the rest of the world?  We want to help the generations to come see the world from our eyes, experience the wonders that brought us up, and ultimately carry on the legacy of the great story tellers that came before us.<br><br>As a team we are currently working hard to produce contents and update as much as we possibly could. The first iteration of the project didn't turn out as well as we hoped. First of all, the overall look of the web page seem great during our planning phase, however the final design of the web site couldn't have the authenticity that we originally intended to have. The main issue arises from the fact that we were limited in our ability to code and overall knowledge of general web layout. All in all we did achieve what we originally set out to do, which was having a site to display our original content in a simple and straight forward manner.</p>

                    <p>Through SWOT analysis, we found that targeted age group should range from 10-22. We had a general consensuses that we want the website to be simple and kid friendly. As we divided the work load, my specific task was to design the website layout with another member as well as create the name and logo for the site.</p>

                      <p>Given the proper chance on creating another project, I would definitely spend more time on the idealization and creative process phase as currently the layout and the website still needs great amount of work. My original approach was to sketch only about 10 wire-frames for the layout and worked around those. However, this course has demonstrated to me that we must go through a lot more designs and sketches in order to have a chance of creating something extraordinary.</p>

                      <p>As my skills  began to further developed, my friends and I decided that we should implement a new look to the site, something that's more clean and simple for the users. The goal was to remove unnecessary elements while implementing new elements that would help the user better navigate through the site. What started as some simple changes end up being a big overhaul of the entire website.</p>
